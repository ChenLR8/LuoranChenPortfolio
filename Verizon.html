        <p>Many people are unaware that Verizon offers a wide range of tech accessories and is always ready to provide assistance with any related issues. So, we aim to embed this fact into our customers' perceptions using a simple but powerful line:</p>
        <h3 class="verizon">You are all set!</h3>
        <p>Accessory purchases are often driven by immediate needs rather than proactive planning. That's why we want to evoke a sense of relief and reassurance in our customers when they come to Verizon. By saying "You are all set!", we want customers to feel confident that Verizon has taken care of their needs and they can leave with a sense of satisfaction.</p>
